This is a small project based on an IMDB Data set contain list of 3000 movies and the corresponding details. I explored the data and check its sanity.
Further, I  answered the following questions:
1.Which movie made the highest profit? Who were its producer and director? Identify the actors in that film.
2.This data has information about movies made in different languages. Which language has the highest average ROI (return on investment)?
3.Find out the unique genres of movies in this dataset.
4.Make a table of all the producers and directors of each movie. Find the top 3 producers who have produced movies with the highest average RoI?
5.Which actor has acted in the most number of movies? Deep dive into the movies, genres and profits corresponding to this actor.
6.Top 3 directors prefer which actors the most?
